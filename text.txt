PoemIn times of a destitute feeling…
The wishing!.. What good is to wish with no merit or end?

To love... but then whom?... For a time, isn’t worth the travail;
Forever, no love has the vigor.
To search in your heart? – There the past has dissolved with no trail:
The torments, the joys – all is empty and meager...

The passions?.. – But sooner or later the judgment comes by 
To scatter their pains, sweet though flimsy;
And life, as you see it around with a passionless eye,
Is such a deflated and meaningless whimsy…Lermontov
